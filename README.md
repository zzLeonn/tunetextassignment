# TuneText: Music Lyric Search Application

## Overview

The **TuneText** project aims to develop a web application that allows users to search for music lyrics efficiently. By leveraging a large database of song lyrics, the application will provide users with the ability to input specific queries and retrieve corresponding lyrics in a timely manner. This application is part of an academic project under the supervision of Dr. Myo Myo Than Naing at the University of Sunderland, School of Computer Science.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the **TuneText** project is to:

1. Develop an efficient search mechanism for music lyrics.
2. Ensure a user-friendly interface that supports diverse search queries.
3. Address relevant social, ethical, professional, and legal issues related to the handling of song lyrics data.

## Project Structure

### Frontend

The frontend of the TuneText application will be built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It will provide an interactive user interface for users to input song titles, artist names, or keywords to find lyrics.

### Backend

The backend will be implemented using **Node.js** and will interact with a database to fetch lyrics. **MongoDB** will be used for storing song data, including lyrics, artist names, and other relevant metadata.

### Search Algorithm

The search algorithm will be optimized for both speed and relevance. Techniques like **full-text search** and **fuzzy matching** will be employed to ensure users are able to find lyrics even when their input is incomplete or contains minor typos.

## Ethical, Social, and Legal Considerations

### Social Issues

- **Impact on Stakeholders**: The application will improve access to song lyrics, providing a valuable tool for musicians, educators, and fans.
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: TuneText will support a diverse range of music genres and languages, fostering inclusivity for a global audience.
- **Cultural and Community Considerations**: The platform will respect cultural differences and aim to provide lyrics from a variety of international music traditions, promoting cross-cultural engagement.

### Ethical Issues

- **Transparency**: Users will be informed about the data collection process, including how lyrics are sourced and used.
- **Data Privacy**: Any user data collected will be handled with strict confidentiality, ensuring compliance with relevant data protection laws.
- **Environmental Impact**: The project will focus on optimizing code efficiency to reduce unnecessary resource consumption, aiming to minimize its environmental footprint.

### Professional Issues

- **Professional Standards**: The project adheres to professional standards in software development, including best practices for clean code, security, and maintainability.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The application will be regularly updated with bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new features based on user feedback.
- **Conflicts of Interest**: The development of this application will be free from any commercial interests, focusing solely on educational and user-centered goals.

### Legal Issues

- **Data Protection and Privacy**: The TuneText application will ensure compliance with data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to safeguard user privacy.
- **Contracts and Agreements**: Licensing agreements for the usage of song lyrics will be adhered to, ensuring that the platform operates within legal boundaries.
- **Intellectual Property**: Proper care will be taken to respect intellectual property rights concerning song lyrics, and any third-party data will be properly credited.

## Future Work

Future iterations of the **TuneText** project may involve:

- Expanding the database to include a wider variety of lyrics and songs.
- Implementing advanced features such as audio-to-lyrics search integration.
- Integrating social features, such as sharing lyrics or commenting on specific lines.

## Conclusion

The **TuneText** project seeks to create a valuable tool for music enthusiasts, offering a powerful, easy-to-use platform for finding song lyrics. By addressing key social, ethical, professional, and legal considerations, this project will ensure a responsible approach to data usage and software development.
